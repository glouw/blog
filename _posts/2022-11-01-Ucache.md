After finishing roman2 I took almost half a year off from personal programming.
In that time I've been learning music theory, studying the mechanics of the guitar
(I've been playing a Harmony Rocket hollow body), and playing loads of Age of Empires
II with [Luke](https://github.com/lcg4).

Getting back in gear, I devised a minimalistic LRU cache. More info can be found in the
readme, but this ANSI compliant library can be dropped into a web backend to speed
up database reads (like memcache) or popped into an embedded microcontroller to create
a non-persistent database from sensor value readings.

I feel my minimalism growing with each passing publication. Might that be an oxymoron?
